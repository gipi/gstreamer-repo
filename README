This is a repository for a manifest useful to build from the latest
source of gstreamer. Follow the steps outlined below

 $ mkdir gst && cd gst
 $ repo init -u https://github.com/gipi/gstreamer-repo -b 1.2
 $ repo sync
 $ vim 1.2/gstreamer/scripts/gst-uninstalled
 # change line HOME=
 $ ln -sf 1.2/gstreamer/scripts/gst-uninstalled gst-1.2
 $ ./gst-1.2
 $ source ../build/build-lib.sh
 $ build_all

Obviously you need repo to be installed.
